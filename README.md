what is Pixel Nebula:

how to win:
in order to pass each stage, you must kill every enemy, and avoid their bullets. once you finish the final stage, you will win.

what kills you:
getting hit by an enemy bullet will kill you, and send you back to the main menu with one less life. if you run out of lives, the program will quit.
touching an enemy will also kill you, and it will do the same things.
if an enemy gets past you and touches the bottom edge of the screen, you will die.

use left and right arrow keys to select the game type, which is the second main menu option.
